After initial configuration of your github or gitlab credentials (see <href="https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf">here</href>), there are very few commands you need to worry about to upload your content to the server:

git add . 

git commit -m "your messge for the log"

and finally

git commit
