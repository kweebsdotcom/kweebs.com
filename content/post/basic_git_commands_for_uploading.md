After initial configuration of your github or gitlab credentials (see <a href="https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf">here</a>) you normally only use a couple of commands after that.
These are mine:


# Add changes to git.

git add .

# Commit changes.

git commit -m "your message for the log"

# and finally

# Push source and build repos.

git push origin master
