# Hi there

My name is Andre and I'm the author of this websit. I made it to help you present your ideas easier.

We all know how hard is to start something on the web, especially these days. You need to prepare a bunch of stuff, configure them and when that’s done — create the content.

So, there you have it... enjoy!
