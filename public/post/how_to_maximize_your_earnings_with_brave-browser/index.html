<p>As of december 2020 the referral program was shutdown by the Brave Team.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t already know, brave-browser is a chrome based web browser focused on privacy. It has ad-blocking incorporated and many other privacy features that chrome-browser does not have by default.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to explain a little on how to make some money with brave-browser especially the part of the referendums/affiliates that can earn you about $5 (or more depending on who gets your referrals e.g. US is $7,5) per month for each friend that uses your link.</p>
<h2 id="here-is-mine">Here is mine:</h2>
<p><a href="https://brave.com/kwe719">Brave Browser</a></p>
<h5 id="note-from-the-20th-of-this-month-i-stopped-receiving-maybe-because-advertisers-run-out-of-money-">Note: from the 20th of this month I stopped receiving; maybe because advertisers run out of money &hellip;</h5>
<h2 id="what-to-do-to-get-a-little-more-from-brave">What to do to get a little more from Brave</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After doing the installation, you should verify your account at <a href="https://uphold.com">https://uphold.com</a> (here you will have to send your own ID and take a selfie to confirm your identity). In my case it was quite fast, in about 10 minutes I received confirmation that it was verified. <em>I know that this part not everyone likes for privacy reasons, but otherwise you can stop reading ..</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next you go to <a href="https://publishers.basicattentiontoken.org/">https://publishers.basicattentiontoken.org/</a> to become a creator, here you can create various forms of referrals: reddit, github, youtube, vimeo, twitch or even via your website (this can be profitable if you authorize brave to put ads there).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After creating your referrals, share them with your family, friends or elsewhere so that you can receive $ 5 for each one.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="important-note-brave-recently-changed-the-way-referrals-work-and-only-after-your-referrals-have-used-brave-for-30-days-so-dont-worry-if-the--doesnt-fall-right-into-your-uphold-account">Important note: Brave recently changed the way referrals work and only after your referrals have used brave for 30 days, so don&rsquo;t worry if the $$$ doesn&rsquo;t fall right into your uphold account.</h5>
<p>If you have a considerable amount of traffic on your site / youtube / etc I think it will always drip something because brave has the function of auto-contribute (if someone visits your site with the function on, it may be right for you).</p>
<p>I think this is it. Hope you enjoyed this post, don&rsquo;t forget to use my link ;-)</p>
